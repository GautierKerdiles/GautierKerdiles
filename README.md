## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hi! I'm **Gautier Kerdiles**, currently working in **Rates Option Trading at Barclays**.  
I'm passionate about **quantitative finance**, **probability theory**, **mathematical modeling**, and **machine learning**, especially when they converge in **options trading** and **systematic strategies**.

I studied **Fluid Mechanics and Heat Transfer (Aerodynamics)** at **Mines de Douai**, and later joined **ESCP Business School**, specializing in **Market Finance**.  
My goal is to bridge rigorous engineering and mathematical training with financial modeling and data-driven trading strategies.
