## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hi! I'm **Gautier Kerdiles**, currently working in **Rates Option Trading at Barclays**.  
Before moving into finance, I completed internships in **theoretical physics and fluid mechanics** at **Ferrari** and **Dassault Aviation**, where I worked on **aerothermic calculations** and **hypersonic flow modeling** for aerospace applications.  

This engineering foundation in mathematical modeling, heat transfer, and computational physics naturally evolved into a deep interest in quantitative finance, where I now focus on options, stochastic calculus, and machine learning and dataâ€“driven trading strategies.

I studied **Fluid Mechanics and Heat Transfer (Aerodynamics)** at **Mines de Douai**, and later joined **ESCP Business School**, specializing in **Market Finance**. 

My goal is to bridge rigorous engineering and mathematical training with financial modeling and data-driven trading strategies.
